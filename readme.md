# Franka Gazebo Model
This is an attempt to build franka gazebo model with ROS Melodic on
Ubuntu 18.04. 

Basically, it all started with the [Moveit
tutorial](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html)
that talks about controlling the robot on Gazebo. It did not work for
me. The gazebo screen does not show the robot at all. It turns out
that the urdf file generated by moveit assistant manager does not have
all the necessary components to display this robot. 

A bit of google search led me to [this](https://erdalpekel.de/?p=55)
link which I followed to  to rebuild the `franka_ros` package cloned
from
[this](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/tree/melodic-devel)
repository.

You can also clone the repository using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros -b melodic_devel
```
In order to build this package with `catkin`, you might need to
install the following packages

```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-franka-*
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-ros-control
```

After this, you can follow the instructions available on the above
link to modify the respecting xacro, launch and config files. However,
     the instruction is not complete and requires quite a bit of work
     to get them working.

Gazebo model for the franka robot is also available for ROS Kinetic at
[this](https://github.com/mkrizmancic/franka_gazebo) link.  This can
also be used to fix some of the problems that I am facing now. 

I have combined all these modifications and making it available as a
repository with the hope that people can improve on this and learn
from my experience.
